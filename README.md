# Ranker

Create a ranking for any list using only pairwise comparisons (https://pairwiseranker.vercel.app/), using the merge sort algorithm.

## Usage

Enter a list of items you'd like to rank to get started. Choose between items using the buttons or the 1 and 2 keys. Make any final adjustments if needed by dragging and dropping the order at the end.

## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), and start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
